# Generate-Team-Profiles

## Description:
This project is run through Node.js. It uses "Inquirer" as the npm package and "Jest" to run tests on the classes. When you initialize it, it will use prompts to ask you about adding information on your team. You can add three different positions, including: Manager, Engineer, and Intern. Once you answer each question, it will generate a page that displays your team's information. 

## What I Learned:
This was my first project that I used Jest to test my code. That was by far the biggest learning curve. I chose to use the "test" syntax instead of "describe" and "it". I found it to be simpler and cleaner to read. 

The next learning curve was using "when" in the inquirer prompts. I have really appreciated the ease of the syntax in the back-end development. 

Overall, I enjoyed using all the knowledge I have gathered so far to build this project.
